# Target-Pursuit-Machine-Learning-Model-
Designed a Convolutional Neural Network model in PyTorch to predict from the current state of an environment the average number of moves for a bot to reach its target. Created simulation data to train and test the model, evaluated its performance using training and testing loss graphs, and utilized predictions to gauge optimal future decisions
